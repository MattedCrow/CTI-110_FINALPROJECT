You decide against climbing up to the treehouse, passing it off as a likely death trap. A wise choice. However, as you continue along the path, you begin to feel watched.

You start running. The sound of rustling from before has gotten louder. You come to a seemingly dead end, thick bracket blocking your path. Suddenly you feel a sharp pain in your neck. The world around you blurs before going black... Could you have made better choices?
