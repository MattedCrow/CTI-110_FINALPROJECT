"Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! THAT NUMBER, THAT NUMBER!!!"

An excited and babbling screech suddenly came from the being as they started to bounce. The darkness seems to suddenly engulf them before engulfing you as well, completely blacking out your vision and senses.

When your senses return, you find yourself.... in your bed? Was this all a dream?
