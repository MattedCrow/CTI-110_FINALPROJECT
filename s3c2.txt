The being tilts its head to the other side, seemingly curious. You question, what can hear you? How can it hear you?

When you're about to ask about the statement, the being speaks again, tone flat, "Another number, another number, give me another one." Compelled, you have to answer, not noticing the sound of moving in the darkness near you.
