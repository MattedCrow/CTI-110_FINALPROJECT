The being hums lightly to themself, head moving back and forth before it finally lets out a sigh. Arms moved down from where they had been rested in front of them, before moving to the side, a path opening up behind where they had been standing prior.

You follow the path before finally finding your way out of the forest. The events prior to your escape sticks with you as you return to your life.
