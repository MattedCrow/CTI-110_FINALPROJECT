You decide to go down the left path, following it along, scattering leaves with your feet as you move. In the distance, you can hear the sound of an owl crying out and the rustling of branches. A shiver goes down your spine.

The path leads you to an abandoned treehouse. It looks a little rickety, but still stable enough to support your weight. Maybe you can find a way out from up there?
